# Restaurant Page #

This project was made as an assignment from The Odin Project. The main focus on this was to create a restaurant page utilizing Webpack. I went ahead and took a few additional requirements for myself, those of which are: 
- Utilizing the Module Pattern
- Ensuring little to no global variables
- Keeping as many items as possible in either Factory Functions or IIFE's
- Writing as little HTML as possible and focusing on creation of the HTML using JavaScript


Please note inspiration of this project in regards to It's design and images was specifically from a local restaurant in my area. [Sedona's Taphouse](https://sedonataphouse.com/) This is where I drew inspriation from and grabbed images from in order to recreate some parts of the website in my project.

All Credit and resources utilized here comes directly form them and the company that designed their original website.
